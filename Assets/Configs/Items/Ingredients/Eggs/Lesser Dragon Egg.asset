  description: "Not an actual dragon egg but near enough and much easier to come
    across. These eggs are birthed from monsters of the draconic species too small
    to be classified as dragons. Despite that, their eggs still contain powerful
    souls making them superb at crafting equipment capable of holding numerous enchantments.
    \n\nUsed in armour, weapon, and magical engineering. "
